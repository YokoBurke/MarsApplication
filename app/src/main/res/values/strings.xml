    <string name="mars_mission">The Mars 2020 rover mission is
        part of NASAs Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort
        of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars 2020
        mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars
        exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on Mars.
        The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions
        on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself.
        The Mars 2020 rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most
        promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of
        Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and
        demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human
        expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from
        the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water),
        improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, and other
        potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts
        living and working on Mars.</string>
